## Game Story
Archaeologist Piter Miller has dedicated over 15 years to the study of history and archaeology. Occasionally, he is sent on perilous expeditions to gather artifacts. This time, he finds himself in Egypt, poised to explore the ancient pyramid of Tutankhamun. Although he has traversed numerous temples and dungeons, he has never encountered anything extraordinary. This journey, however, is different. Within the dark halls of the pyramid, Piter will confront skeletons, mummies, and an overwhelming aura of mysticism that will forever alter his perception of reality. Will he uncover the artifact and escape the pyramid, or will he be swallowed by its shadows?

## Gameplay
*Egypt Adventure* invites players to explore the depths of Tutankhamun's pyramid, consisting of three ominous floors. The top floor harbors the greatest threat—Tutankhamun himself, who guards his crown. As a roguelike game, each floor is procedurally generated, ensuring unique layouts filled with danger. Players must navigate through darkness armed only with a revolver and a flickering torch, seeking treasures and battling nightmarish foes.

Players can search chests and loot from fallen enemies. Starting with a revolver and a torch, Piter encounters mystical beings wielding ancient magic. To survive, he must collect protective relics and manage limited resources. As the torch burns out, darkness envelops him, making each choice crucial.
